            <p>1. It is unlawful for private sector employers to prohibit employees from discussing wages and compensation, and it has been since the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935.</p>

                And yet! Despite all the genuinely positive benefits that may come from people discussing salaries, we still shy away from talking about it. Why?

                “Money is so tied up with really complex and difficult emotions, like shame, success, fear of failure, and how people view you,” Brianna McGurran, a money expert at the personal finance blog NerdWallet, told me in August.

                “So when you’re talking about how much you earn, or how much you’re saving, a lot of people end up tying that to their self-worth,” she said.

                Further still, there are both cultural and practical roadblocks that actively discourage us from discussing money in general, whether that’s salary talk or sharing how much we’ve saved in a retirement fund.
